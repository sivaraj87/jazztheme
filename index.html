        <p>Let us write, edit, and monitor your Wikipedia page.</p>

        <section>

          <article class="first">
            <h2>We love Wikipedia</h2>
            <p>It’s widely understood that a <a href="#">Wikipedia</a> page about you, your brand, or your business is an excellent marketing tool that greatly improves Search Engine Optimization. But Wikipedia pages that contain marketing language conflict with their policy on article tone and neutrality.</p>
            <p>The Wikipedia Geeks understand this process. Our articles are written to be supportive, all while containing citations to verifiable references. The articles aren’t copied and pasted from your website’s about page. They’re a culmination of information; combined to explain what you, your brand, or your business are all about.</p>
          </article>

          <article class="second">
            <h2>Geeks at heart</h2>
            <p>We’ve been contributing to Wikipedia for a long time. We do it because we believe the internet is a better place when information is shared freely and consumed critically. We understand Wikipedia’s policy on tone and neutrality, and work hard to make contributions that respect those rules. We’ve also spent hundreds of hours learning the Wikipedia markup language and how to format and categorize article content appropriately.</p>
          </article>

          <article class="third">
            <h2>How we work</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>We'll write an article 450-500 words in length for a flat fee of $500. This includes one image or logo with the appropriate info box, article categorization, and at least five links to other Wikipedia pages.</li>
              <li>If your page requires additional elements like sortable tables, track lists, ordered or unordered lists, we’ll evaluate your content and give you a price quote.</li>
              <li>We warranty our work for six months. This means that if we can’t keep your page published for at least six months, we’ll give you a full refund.</li>
              <li>We can’t stop other contributors from editing your page, but we will monitor your page and remove content that isn’t appropriate.</li>
              <li>We’ll monitor the flags that can be placed on a page indicating there are problems with an article. These flags can be very helpful and provide an opportunity to correct problems.</li>
              <li>Our client list is confidential, but we’re happy to provide you with a sample of the pages we’ve created and contributed to.</li>
            </ol>
          </article>

          <article class="fourth">
            <h2>What we need</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>Tell us who you are. Do you need a page for a person, brand, or business?</li>
              <li>Do you have images or a logo that you’d like included? Even when an image or logo is Trademarked &trade;, Registered &reg;, or Copyright &copy; protected, a low resolution version is considered fair use for the purposes of a Wikipedia page.</li>
              <li>Can you provide sources of information beyond a supporting website? For example, if you need an article about your company’s widget, can you point to other articles online or in print that have been written about the widget?</li>
              <li>If you need content removed or edited, can you tell us why? Can you provide a source for the requested edits?</li>
            </ol>
